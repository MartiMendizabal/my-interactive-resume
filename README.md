# my-interactive-resume
This is a self-maneged proyect, to get hands-on with different programming languages I am familiar with.
To execute this interactive resume, make sure that Flask is installed in your computer. You can install it with the command `pip intall Flask`.
Then you are able to run the app with the command `python app.py`. 
A message should appear in your console, something similar to "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/", you should copy that link and paste it on your web browser but do not use Ctrl+C, use Right-click + "Copy".
